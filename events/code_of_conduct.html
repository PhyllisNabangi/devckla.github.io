    <h2>Developer Circle Kampala Event Code of Conduct</h2>
    <p>
        All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at events hosted by Developer Circle Kampala, or events
        representing Developer Circle Kampala, are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all
        participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>The Quick Version</h3>

        Developer Circle Kampala is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of gender,
        gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
        ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of event
        participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks,
        workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned
        or expelled from the event without a warning at the discretion of the event organizers or Developer Circle Kampala leads.
    </p>

        <h3>The Less Quick Version</h3>

        Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
        orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual
        images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording,
        sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

        Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

        Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized
        images, activities, or other material. Sponsor staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised
        clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

        If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers or Developer Circle Kampala leads may take any action
        they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund.

        If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please
        contact an organizing committee member of Developer Circle Kampala, Or Lead or Venue staff immediately.

        Developer Circle Kampala staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide
        escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value
        your attendance. We expect participants to follow these rules at all Developer Circle Kampala related events across venues.
